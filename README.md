# ForeshoreTool

A foreshore vulnerability assessment tool for the Upper Bay of Fundy, Canada. This tool is intended to help mitigate the vulnerability of coastal dykes to wave attack and overtopping, by assessing the current and future status of the foreshore's ability to full attenuate incoming waves. This may assist in future dyke realignment planning by showing how much foreshore is needed and the approximate extent of foreshore erosion over a time horizon.
